### Introduction to Swift

The official Swift Documentation at **[docs.swift.org](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)** provides a thorough overview of the programming language. I highly recommend it for anyone who is determined to become an iOS Developer.

### Playgrounds

Apple introduced Playgrounds in 2016 as a new way to write code using Swift. As a beginner, this is a great way to learn how to code.

### Latest Version of Swift

Swift 4.2 is the latest version of the language. Swift 5.0 is expected in the spring of 2019.
