### Multi-line Strings

I didn't know that the `"""` had to be on its own line for the opening and closing lines.

❌:
```swift
var multilineString = """
This
is
a
multiline
string"""
```

✅:
```swift
var multilineString = """
This
is
a
multiline
string
"""
```

[Multi-line strings – Swift in Sixty Seconds](https://youtu.be/Ppl-8E1YgRU)

1. Three `"""` on their own lines
2. Opening and closing line breaks won't be included in your string
3. To ignore a new line , add a backslash `\`
