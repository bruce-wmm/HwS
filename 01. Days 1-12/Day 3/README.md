#3 - I forgot how to declare a closed range. This is perfectly valid code:

```swift
let passingGrade = 70...100
```

#6 - I went too quickly on this question and ignored the fact that a conditional statement can be written by itself on a line without printing/returning anything:

```swift
70 > 100
```

### 💡 New Concepts:
- Conditional statements can be used on strings, following alphabetical order.
- Watch out for integers represented as strings and type cast them correctly when doing conditional statements.
