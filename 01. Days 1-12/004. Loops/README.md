## Day 4 Notes

‚ùóÔ∏è**I need more practice with loops!** The biggest struggle was with `while` loops...I find them difficult because there are several variable counts to keep track of at once for each iteration, and I tend to rush through the calculations in my head. **Slow down!**

### While Loops

#6 - I ignored the fact that 0 % 2 is 0.

#7 - Should have seen that the last iteration that executes prints two times.

### Repeat Loops

#10 - `while false` will end the loop, but only after the for loop has run at least one time through.

### Skipping Items

#2 - Pay attention to detail, you're missing a `{`.

#9 - The `repeat` works one way for a bit and then the condition kicks in and it works another way until the `while` is false.

### Infinite Loops

#5 - `while` loops don't execute on false.

#8 - `while true` is not a valid condition for the loop

### üí° New Concepts:
- `repeat` loops execute at least once no matter what. `while` loops do not.
