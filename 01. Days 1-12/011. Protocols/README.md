#3 - Valid Swift - the `mutating` keyword is not mandatory in this case, but if you were to expand the implementation in the future youâ€™d want it in case youâ€™re dealing with value types such as Structs or Enumerations.

### ðŸ’¡ New Concepts:

- Classes cannot have multiple inheritance, but Protocols can.
- If you define a protocol instance method requirement that is intended to mutate instances of any type that adopts the protocol, mark the method with the `mutating` keyword as part of the protocolâ€™s definition. This enables structures and enumerations to adopt the protocol and satisfy that method requirement. Remember that you don't need to add `mutating` when writing an implementation of that method for a class.
