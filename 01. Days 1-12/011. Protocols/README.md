### ðŸ’¡ New Concepts:

- Classes cannot have multiple inheritance, but Protocols can.
- If you define a protocol instance method requirement that is intended to mutate instances of any type that adopts the protocol, mark the method with the `mutating` keyword as part of the protocolâ€™s definition. This enables structures and enumerations to adopt the protocol and satisfy that method requirement. Remember that you don't need to add `mutating` when writing an implementation of that method for a class.
