# Day 1 Notes

I didn't know the proper syntax for multi-line comments prior to today.

```swift
var multilineComment = """
This
is
a
multiline
comment
"""
```

1. Three `"""` on their own lines!
2. Opening and closing line breaks won't be included in your string
3. To ignore a new line , add a backslash `\`
