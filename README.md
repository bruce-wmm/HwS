# 100 Days Of Swift

```
"Can I jump over two or three guys like I used to? No.
Am I as fast as I used to be? No, but I still have the fundamentals and smarts.
That's what enables me to still be a dominant player. As a kid growing up, I never skipped steps.
I always worked on fundamentals because I know athleticism is fleeting."

   - Kobe Bryant
