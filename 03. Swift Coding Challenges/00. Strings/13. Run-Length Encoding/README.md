#### Challenge 13: Run-Length Encoding

Most commonly used to compress image data files on a computer.

[Run-length encoding (RLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) is a very simple form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs. Consider, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, and animations. **It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could greatly increase the file size.**
