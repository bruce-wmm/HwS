### Referring to the Current Instance

#6 - Valid Swift - one of the stored properties is initialized when it is declared, so it doesnâ€™t need to be in the `init()` method

#9 - The syntax is correct but the types are not. You cannot initialize a String with an Int value.

### Static Properties and Methods

#5 - Valid Swift - Uses the member-wise initializer to initialize `player` when instantiating a variable

#7 - Static member `population` cannot be used on instance of type `Person`

#8 - Instance member `ticketsUsed` cannot be used on type `Raffle`

#10 - Cannot use mutating member on immutable value: 'allCats' is a 'let' constant

### Access Control

#2 - You retain the member-wise initializer, but due to the access control of `currentPatient` being private, you donâ€™t get to use it, so itâ€™s effectively negated and throws an error

#5 - `customerPrice` is a Double and `actualPrice` is an Int

#11 - If you only have private variables, you can use an empty constructor as a member-wise initializer

### ðŸ’¡ New Concepts:

- You retain the member-wise initializer, but due to the access control of `currentPatient` being private, you donâ€™t get to use it, so itâ€™s effectively negated and throws an error
- If you only have private variables, you can use an empty constructor as a member-wise initializer
